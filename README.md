# Weather App

Live version: https://weather-c2a92.web.app/

This is my first ever project using Angular 2+. Search for your city using the search bar to get live weather data (i.e. humidity, wind speed, uv index). Weather themed animations will run depending on the weather condition. This project was made two months ago, but I just uploaded it to github. Definitely lots room to improve code.

If you run this in your computer, note that you will need to obtain an API key from weatherstack and include it in the apixu.service.ts file.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
